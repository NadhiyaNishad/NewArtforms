    <p>This form of painting originated in the 19th century in Bengal. These paintings were made on cloth or patas and often depicted images of gods, goddesses and scenes from epics. This simple yet captivating form of art became popular due to its way of capturing everyday lives beautifully. The seamless, free-flowing outline is a unique feature of the Kalighat paintings. This style of painting has been an inspiration to many artists since its creation.</p>
