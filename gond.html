        <p>A native art form of Madhya Pradesh, Gond paintings are mostly themed on animals and birds. Practised by the Gond tribes, this art form is believed to be 1400 years old. Natural colours derived from plant sap, charcoal, coloured soil, cow dung, leaves, etc. are used to make this type of painting. This simple art form created with dots and lines was made as an offering to Mother Nature in earlier days</p>
