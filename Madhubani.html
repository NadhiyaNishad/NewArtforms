    <p>This art is also known as Mithila art, and it originated in the kingdom of Janak in Nepal and in present-day Bihar. This art form was not known to the rest of the world until the 1930s, when it was discovered after an earthquake. Mostly practiced by women, these paintings or wall murals depict gods, fauna and flora. Characterised by geometric patterns, this art form is greatly admired for its evocative portrayal of traditions and cultures.</p>
