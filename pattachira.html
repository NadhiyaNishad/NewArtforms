    <p>Pattachitra art forms date back to the 5th century and originated in Odisha and West Bengal. These cloth-based scroll paintings have a heavy influence of the Mughal era. Admired by art lovers, the Pattachitra paintings are dedicated to religious and mythological themes. The painters mainly use bright colours like red, black, indigo, yellow and white in this type of painting. From palm leaves to silks, this art form has gained recognition and is practiced even today.</p>
