    <p>This form of art originated in present-day Telangana and has been practised by the Nakashi family through generations. The Kalamkari art influenced the creation of the Cheriyal scrolls. The scrolls are generally 40â€“45 feet in length, and the themes are mainly centred on Indian mythology and folk traditions. These types of paintings are made with bright hues, with red as a dominating background. The colours are extracted from natural sources by the artists, and the brushes are made with squirrel hair.</p>
