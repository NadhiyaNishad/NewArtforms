    <p>This form of art dates back to 2500 BCE, and it was practiced by the Warli tribes from Thane and Nasik in Maharashtra. These paintings mostly illustrate the nature and social rituals of the tribe. It portrays daily activities like farming, praying, dancing, hunting, etc. Geometrical patterns in white against a yellow or red background are some of the main themes. Warli paintings were usually made by married women to celebrate a wedding, and they were also used to decorate huts of the Warli tribes.</p>
